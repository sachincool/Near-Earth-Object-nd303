- Major bugs solved was the set not able to filter on the Neo objects. Solved it by implementing **eq** and **hash** functions

- few difficulties in database.py, multiple times had to rethink
- Search.py apply function made by use of operators, how to use OrbitPath when calling with diameter as filter
- I wish to implement the distance functionality without creating an extra map of neo_name_data although this works. Its not the best solution.
